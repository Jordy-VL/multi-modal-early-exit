--> pareto-optimal? 

## Installation

The scripts require [python >= 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) to run.
We will create a fresh virtualenvironment in which to install all required packages.
```sh
mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 EE
```

Using poetry and the readily defined pyproject.toml, we will install all required packages
```sh
workon EE 
pip3 install poetry
poetry install
```
